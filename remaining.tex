\chapter{Remaining Work and Timeline}
Some of the remaining tasks and timeline for their completion are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and implementation of the programming model for incremental graph processing using GPUs [January 2016]
\item Designing the data-structure to store the input graph and updates for incremental out-of-core graph processing. [February 2016]
\item Implementation of three different classes of graph algorithms using the proposed incremental graph processing programming model. [March 2016]
\item Designing experiments and performance evaluation of the applications implemented in the proposed framework. [March 2016]
\item Writing and paper submission [April 2016]
\end{itemize}
