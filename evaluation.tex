\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Graph Datasets}
We will evaluate the performance and efficiency of our framework using a mix of real- world and synthetic datasets. Examples of few real-world datasets include Facebook interaction graph and graphs from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix collection e.g. LiveJournal. The synthetic datasets are obtained from the Graph500 RMAT data generator using scales ranging from 20 to 23 graphs with average degree of 16 per vertex.

\subsection{Evaluation Platform}
Evaluations will be on a typical heterogeneous HPC node equipped with 16-core Intel Xeon E5-2670 processors running at 2.6 GHz with 32 GB of DDR3 RAM, and one attached NVIDIA Tesla K20c GPU with 13 SMX multiprocessors and 4.8 GB GDDR5 RAM. All the runs will be compiled with the highest optimization level flag.
