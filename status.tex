As a part of the proposal we have already built \textit{Rain}~\cite{Rain} and \textit{Strings}~\cite{Strings} scheduling frameworks to handle GPGPU multi-tenancy for cloud workloads. Rain and Strings were published in VTDC 2013 and SC 2014 respectively. To demonstrate out-of-core  processing of irregular applications using GPUs, we built \textit{GraphReduce}~\cite{GraphReduce} framework for efficient processing of  large-scale graph on GPUs with limited memory. This work was published in the SC 2015. \textit{NVPro}~\cite{NVPro} is an emulation work on non-volatile persistent memory characterizing slow and fast memory.  NVPro was published in ICPE 2015. We have also proposed a novel CPU-based incremental graph processing programming model. This work is under review at IPDPS 2016.

To summarize, following is the list of projects done as a part of the proposal:  
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{ Rain}/\textit{Strings} for enterprise and data center workload scheduling on GPUs. [VTDC '13, SC '14]
\item \textit{NVPro} for slow and fast memory characterization. [ICPE '15]
\item \textit{GraphReduce} for large scale graph analytics on GPUs with limited memory [SC '15]	
\item \textit{GraphIn}: An Online High Performance Incremental Graph Processing Framework [IPDPS '15 under submission]
\end{itemize}
